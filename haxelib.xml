	<description>MassiveUnit is a cross-platform haXe unit testing framework from Massive Interactive that utilises haxe metadata markup for test cases and includes tools for generating, compiling and running test cases from the command line.</description>
	<version name="0.9.1.2">Switched sequential target testing to parallel testing for speed increase. Removed -swf8 and -swf9 options and replaced them with -as2 and -as3. Removed -keep-browser-alive option and replaced it with -kill-browser (Chrome only due to restrictions). Added new frame based test result viewer in browser.
