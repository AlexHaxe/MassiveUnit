usage: gen [srcPath] [hxmlPath]

    The 'gen' task is used to create and update the test runner classes. The 
    first time this command runs it will generate a TestMain, TestSuite and
    ExampleTest class in the test src directory provided. On subsequent 
    runs it will only update the TestSuite with all the test files in the 
    src directory so not to overwrite any customisation in TestMain.
    
    All test classes must follow the following naming convention to be
    included in the generated TestSuite: *Test.hx 
    
    Refer to the generated TestExample for sync and async test usage.
